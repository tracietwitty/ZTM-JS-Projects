# Explanation of the Project

This app fetches images from the Unsplash API and monitors when the images are loaded in order to dynamically hide the display animation. This way, the images seem to go on indefinitely.


## How I'd improve:

I'd like to use the API to get specific collections to show instead of totally random pictures (i.e. nature, concerts, food, etc.).
