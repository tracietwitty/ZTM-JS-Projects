# Quote Generator  :speech_balloon:

## Description

>This project was an exercise in making requests to external APIs and displaying the result on screen for the user.


I was able to practice making asynchronous Fetch requests to an API to retrieve quotes, and learn how to deal with cores error using a proxy API.

This project is responsive, although I did not design it using mobile-first methods.


## Ideas for future improvements:
- Improve readability with more concise naming

- Avoid recursive functions
    - getQuote()

- Make my own proxy API to avoid the 429 error I was getting
